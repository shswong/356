Compiling the elevator simulation example:

1) Download the Java 2 Platform Standard Edition (J2SE) from java.sun.com
2) Go into the "elevator simulation" directory.
3) type "javac *.java" to compile the java files to class files
   (Note: This step may be skipped since I have already included the class files).
4) type "java LiftSim" to run the program
